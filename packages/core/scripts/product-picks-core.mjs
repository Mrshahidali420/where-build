/**
 * The rules that turn publisher records into product picks, pure, so the
 * tests can hand in their own records. scripts/picks-from-products.mjs runs
 * them on the amazon-products crawl.
 *
 * The crawl looked up the most read titles in publisher and library records
 * (Open Library and the like) and wrote down every official English product
 * it could tie to an Amazon ASIN. From that, each title gets at most three
 * picks: volume 1, one box set and one disc. A reader on a title page wants
 * the place to start, not a shelf of forty volumes.
 *
 * Only what the site needs is kept: { a, n, t }, the same shape as the hand
 * picks. No price, no tag and no disclosure text: the price is Amazon's to
 * show, the tag is added when the link is drawn (src/lib/picks.js), and the
 * Associates sentence lives in the footer and on /privacy only.
