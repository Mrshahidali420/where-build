/**
 * DAILY REFRESH. This is the one GitHub Actions runs every night.
 *
 * It never re-downloads a title we already have. It works in two phases:
 *
 *   PHASE 1 - PROBE (cheap)
 *     Ask AniList for "id + updatedAt" only, newest edits first, and newest
 *     ids first. 50 rows per call, two small fields. Compare each row with
 *     data/seen.json. Stop the sweep as soon as we reach rows we already
 *     match. Most days this is 4 to 10 calls.
 *
 *   PHASE 2 - FETCH (targeted)
 *     Download the full record ONLY for the ids phase 1 marked as changed or
 *     new, 50 ids per call. If nothing changed, this phase costs zero calls.
 *
 * It builds on data/comics.json, data/anime.json and data/characters.json,
 * so it never needs the big raw dump from the full backfill.
 *
 * Run it:
 *   npm run ingest:daily
 *
 * Options (environment variables):
 *   MAX_CALLS=240      hard ceiling on API calls (default 240)
 *   MAX_PROBE_PAGES=40 how deep a probe sweep may go before it gives up
 *
 * data/keep.json lists ids that are fetched every night no matter what the
 * probe says. See scripts/keep-list.mjs.
