/**
 * The "What to do" lines on /my-admin.
 *
 * Each rule is a plain function: numbers in, one hint out, or null when there
 * is nothing worth saying. No database, no page, so every rule is tested with
 * fixed numbers (tests/admin-hints.test.js).
 *
 * A hint is { text, level }. level is 'act' (do something), 'watch' (keep an
 * eye on it) or 'good' (it works, leave it alone).
 *
 * Two rules hold for every hint here:
 *   - A small number says nothing. Every rule has a floor, so one visitor
 *     cannot fill the page with advice.
 *   - Never "noindex" a page. A thin page that already ranks is made fuller,
 *     never hidden from Google.
