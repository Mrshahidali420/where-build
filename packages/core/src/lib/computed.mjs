/**
 * Facts this site works out for itself.
 *
 * Everything here is arithmetic on data we already hold: how many official
 * platforms carry a title, which languages they publish in, how the anime and
 * the comic line up, and the order a series is meant to be read in. None of
 * it is copied from anywhere, and none of it is a guess.
 *
 * Two rules, the same two that govern answers.mjs:
 *   1. It imports platform-facts.js and answers.mjs and NOTHING else, so the
 *      Worker can run it at request time.
 *   2. It never states more than the numbers support. Where a fact would need
 *      a human to check it (which chapter an episode ends on, for example),
 *      the text says what is generally true instead of inventing a number.
