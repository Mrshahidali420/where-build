/**
 * The night job.
 *
 * Every page view, click and exit is written to the `events` table as it
 * happens. That table is fast to write and expensive to read: asking it "how
 * did last month go" would walk a few hundred thousand rows every time the
 * dashboard is opened, and Cloudflare's free allowance is 5 million row reads
 * a day. Opened twice a minute on a phone, that allowance is gone by lunch.
 *
 * So once a night, after a day is closed, that day is squeezed into a handful
 * of small tables: one row per page, per country, per platform, per move
 * between sections. Those tables are tiny and are kept forever. The raw rows
 * are then thrown away after 30 days.
 *
 * The result: "today" and "yesterday" are exact and detailed, "last 7 days"
 * and "all time" are exact totals, and nothing ever grows without a limit.
 *
 * It runs from the `scheduled` handler in src/worker.js at 00:10 UTC.
