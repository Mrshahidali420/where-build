/**
 * The answer pages.
 *
 * Every page on this site should answer one question a real person typed into
 * a search box, in our own words, from facts we already hold. These builders
 * take one catalog record and return the text for a whole page.
 *
 * Two rules keep this file safe:
 *   1. It imports platform-facts.js and names.mjs (pure, import-free) and
 *      NOTHING else. No catalog, no JSON. That lets the Worker run it at
 *      request time and lets make-shards.mjs run it at build time from plain
 *      node.
 *   2. It states only what the record and the platform facts already say.
 *      No guessing, no prices, no promises about a licence we cannot see.
 *
 * Because platform facts belong to the PLATFORM, a title added tomorrow gets
 * a complete set of answer pages tomorrow with no extra step.
