/**
 * Where the reading room gets its numbers.
 *
 * There are two stores. The one-by-one `events` table is exact and can draw a
 * journey, but it is expensive to read and only the last 30 days are kept. The
 * nightly `daily_*` tables are tiny and kept forever, but a day only lands
 * there after midnight.
 *
 * So: a short range reads the raw table. A long range reads the nightly tables
 * for the closed days and adds today from the raw table on top. "All time"
 * never touches the raw table at all.
 *
 * Every function here returns plain rows with the same field names, whichever
 * store answered, so a page never has to know where a number came from.
